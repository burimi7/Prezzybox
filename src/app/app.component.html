    <p>
      Dad’s taxi is the cheapest, most used taxi on earth (probably). <br />
      Wherever your little ones need to go, dad’s cab company is usually the first port of call. <br />
      Like being constantly exhausted, ferrying the kids around is part and parcel of fatherhood, and it’s one that dads
      usually don’t mind. <br />
      But this Father’s Day, why not pull the old switcheroo, and ask the kids to give a little back? <br />
      Our Father’s Day Chore Calculator tells you exactly what the children need to do to pay you back for your
      hard-earned petrol.<br />
      Simply enter the number of miles you rack up in Dad’s taxi per week, and we’ll give them a list of ‘repayment’
      tasks.
      <br /><br />
      Happy Father’s Day, dads!
